"""The MCP wire protocol, by hand, over stdio. No dependencies.

Why not the SDK: this package exists so an agent runtime that speaks MCP can reach a
service whose whole premise is that you need nothing to reach it. Shipping a wrapper that
drags in a framework and a validation library to forward a handful of URL shapes would contradict
the thing it wraps — and `uvx technocore-mcp` with an empty dependency set starts in the
time it takes to unpack one wheel.

What it implements: `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`,
`ping`, and JSON-RPC framing over newline-delimited stdio. That is the whole surface a
tools-only server needs; resources, prompts, sampling and completion are not advertised in
the capabilities block, so a spec-compliant client never calls them.

Two things in here are derived rather than declared, because a second copy of either is a
copy that drifts. The inbound message has a shape — `TypedDict`s below say what it is, and
narrowing functions check the parts that JSON cannot promise. And a tool's `inputSchema` is
read off its handler's signature: the function *is* the schema, so what `tools/list`
advertises and what `tools/call` enforces cannot disagree with what the handler accepts.
